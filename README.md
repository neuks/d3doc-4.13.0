# D3: Data-Driven Documents

<a href="https://d3js.org"><img src="https://d3js.org/logo.svg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>

**D3** (or **D3.js**) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

## Modification to the original project

D3 is a great work for browser graphics, but its documentation lacks formal management, the official project page always shows the documentation of the latest updates, so here I collected all its documentation according to v4.13.0, the last version of 4.0, so that people like me who works on it would have a little ease.

To use this project, you simplely have to open the [Complete API Reference](https://github.com/neuks/d3doc-4.13.0/blob/master/API.md) or download it manually and save it to your local html file, so it will be handy at work.

Cheers!

## Installing

If you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
```

For the minified version:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

You can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection):

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.js"></script>
```

D3 is written using [ES2015 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). Create a [custom bundle using Rollup](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4), Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:

```js
import {scaleLinear} from "d3-scale";
```

Or import everything into a namespace (here, `d3`):

```js
import * as d3 from "d3";
```

In Node:

```js
var d3 = require("d3");
```

You can also require individual modules and combine them into a `d3` object using [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign):

```js
var d3 = Object.assign({}, require("d3-format"), require("d3-geo"), require("d3-geo-projection"));
```
